# Electron image viewer

A quick and dirty image viewer made in 6 hours over 4 days.

Uses [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) + [Ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive) + [Photon](https://github.com/connors/photon/).

Supports only those image formats supported by Chromium: JPG, PNG, GIF, BPM, WEBP and SVG.

**Shortcuts**:
* left and right arrow for previous/next image
* "f" to toggle fullscreen
* esc to exit fullscreen or quit the application
